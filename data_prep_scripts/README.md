# Data preparation scripts
<p>The R scripts in this folder are for preparing data produced by our [Plotter application](https://www.trafforddatalab.io/plotter/) for publication via our [Explore application](https://www.trafforddatalab.io/explore/).</p>
<p>The process generally requires the spatial data created in Plotter to be combined with other information provided in a CSV file containing a joining variable. The resultant output is then styled and created as a separate file which is visualised within Explore.</p>
